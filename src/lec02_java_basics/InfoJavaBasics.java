2) What is Java Indentation? 
-- A new Java programmer must master the concept of "indentation" in Java. Indentation is used to make our code readable to other users, easier to edit, display how the braces match up and show the logic of the program in an organized fashion. 
How to solve indentation issue:
	i) for multiple lines
	Control/Command + a
	Shift + Control/Command + f
   	
	ii) for a single line if white space is absent
	Control/Command + i

/*

1) Variable classification based on position?
-- global variable or class variable
-- local variable

2) What is constructor in java?
-- A constructor is a special method that is used to initialize a newly created object and is called just after the memory is allocated for the object. 

3) Classification of Constructor?
-- Default Constructor or no argument constructor
-- Parameterized Constructor
-- you shouldn't write a parameterized constructor without writing a default constructor. It's a norm.

4) What is the "this" keyword in java? **********
-- 'this' keyword represents an instance of the class. ‘this’ can be used to access class methods and variables.
-- Instance: a step, stage, or situation viewed as part of a process or series of events. 

5) How can we create a parameterized constructor by eclipse feature?
 -- select all the variables, then right click
 -- Select source --move to ‘generate constructor using fields’
 -- Then Choose where you want to create it by selecting insertion point
 -- Choose after the last one

6) Alternative:
-- from Header of eclipse IDE -- select source -- follow above step

7) Important Info:
-- When we put local variables inside the constructor or method, they are in general called Parameter, when we put the value (when class is instantiated) under the main method, they are called arguments.

1) What is Java StringBuffer?
-- Java StringBuffer class is used to create mutable (modifiable) String objects. The StringBuffer class in Java is the same as String class except it is mutable i.e. it can be changed.
-- Java StringBuffer class is thread-safe i.e. multiple threads cannot access it simultaneously. So it is safe and will result in an order.
-- A String that can be modified or changed is known as a mutable String. StringBuffer and StringBuilder classes are used for creating mutable strings.

2) What is Java StringBuilder?
-- Java StringBuilder class is used to create mutable (modifiable) String. The Java StringBuilder class is the same as the StringBuffer class except that it is non-synchronized. 
-- It is available since JDK 1.5.

1) What are Java Operators?
-- Operators are used to perform operations on variables and values.
Classification:Arithmetic Operators, Comparison Operators, Logical Operators, Assignment Operators

2) What are Arithmetic Operators?
-- Arithmetic operators are used to perform common mathematical operations. see below:
+ Addition
- Subtraction
* Multiplication
/ Division
% Modulus/Remainder
Below 2 will use when we will learn loop
++ Increment
-- Decrement

3) What are Comparison Operators?
-- Comparison operators are used to compare two values. see below:
== Equal to operator
!= Not Equal
> Greater than 
< Less than
>= Greater than or equal to
<= Less than or equal to

4) What are Logical Operators?
-- Logical operators are used to determine the logic between variables or values. see below:

&& -->  Logical and operator (Returns true if both statements are true, 
x < 5 &&  x < 10)
|| --> Logical or operator (Returns true if one of the statements is true,
x < 5 || x < 4)
!  -->  Logical not operator (Reverse the result, returns false if the result is true, (!(x < 5 && x < 10))

5) What are Assignment Operators? (When we learn loop, we will use them)
-- Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables. see below:
			Example     What does it mean
=         x=5            x=5
+=       x+=3           x=x+3
-=        x-=3           x=x-3

6) What is a Conditional Statement?
-- Conditional Statements allow the program to behave differently based on condition. 
-- Example: if, else, else if, switch.

7) Describe- if else condition.
-- First keyword is if. Generally we don't use 2 separate if conditions in code (code wise OK). 
-- Rather we use if as first condition and else or else if as second condition. 
-- Generally the true statement is written at the end.
-- When we write else, no condition is necessary to write,
-- Whatever you want to print, it will be printed. either it is true or false, correct or incorrect
-- But if we wish to write a second condition , we have to use ‘else if’, not ‘else’. 

8) What is an Even number?
-- A number divided by 2 with remainder 0.
-- Example - 56 : 8/2 --- quotient 28, remainder 0

9) What is an Odd number?
-- A number divided by 2 with remainder 1.
-- Example - 37 : 9/2 --- quotient 18, remainder 1
